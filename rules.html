                    Chess is a two-player game played on a square board divided into 64 squares of alternating colors. <br>
                    Each player starts with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns.
                    The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, which means putting it in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each piece moves in a specific way:
                    <br>
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - The king moves one square in any direction.
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - The queen can move any number of squares in any direction.
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Rooks move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Bishops move any number of squares diagonally.
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Knights move in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular to it.
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   - Pawns move forward one square, but capture diagonally. On their first move, pawns can also move two squares forward.
                        <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  - Pieces capture opponents' pieces by moving to their squares. A piece is removed from the board when captured.

                    
                    <br><br>
                    The game starts with the player controlling the white pieces making the first move, followed by alternate moves between the players.
                    Players can castle, a special move that involves moving the king and one rook together under certain conditions. It is a way to safeguard the king and activate the rook.
                    
                    <br> <br>Note: En passant is a special pawn capture that can occur if a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn. The opponent has the opportunity to capture the pawn "en passant" on the next move.
                    When a pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it can be promoted to any other piece (except a king) of the player's choice.
                    
                    
                    <br> <br> The game ends when checkmate occurs, a player resigns, there is a draw (stalemate, insufficient material, threefold repetition, etc.), or an agreed-upon draw by both players.
